# The Big Picture

## Get to Know Git

### Put a Project on Git
- Use `git init` to initialize the project folder.
- From GitHub, create the repo, **DO NOT** add a .README file **THIS IS CRITICAL**.
    - Follow the git instructions that GitHub provides to connect local to remote.

### Creating a Snapshot
- Use `git status` to view the status of files in the repo.
- `git add <files>` to add the updated files/directories to the future snapshot. This is called the "Index".
- `git commit -m "message"` will create the snapshot in the local repository.
- `git log` view the history of the snapshots.
- `git diff` view the differences of two commits. Use the first few characters of the commit hashes.
